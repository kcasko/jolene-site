**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026

---

## PART 1: INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

You are helping build a portfolio website for surreal digital collage artist and graphic designer Jolene Casko.

You are given a structured background document about Jolene Casko (bio, practice, platforms, NFTs, prints, features, and social links). Treat that document as the **single source of truth**. Do not invent biographical facts, dates, or platform names that are not supported by the document. You may creatively phrase things, but the underlying facts must remain accurate and consistent with the source.

### Your Tasks:

#### 1. Overall Voice and Tone

- Write in a warm, confident, professional tone that fits an independent surreal digital collage artist.
- Emphasize imagination, symbolism, and craftsmanship without sounding overly abstract.
- Write in third person ("she," "her," "Jolene") for descriptive sections, and second person ("you") when directly addressing potential collectors or clients (e.g., on the Home or Contact pages).

#### 2. Pages to Generate

Using ONLY the information from the background doc, create polished copy for these pages.

For each page, provide:
- A main headline
- A 1–2 sentence subheadline
- 2–4 short sections with headings and body copy
- 3–5 short alternative headline options (tagline ideas)

**Home**
- Introduce Jolene Casko and what makes her work distinctive (surreal digital collage, vintage/public-domain sources, symbolic narratives).
- Briefly mention: location (Pennsylvania, USA), digital collage focus, prints, NFTs, and editorial/feature presence.
- Include a short "Call to action" inviting visitors to view portfolio, shop prints, or explore NFTs.

**About**
- Expand on her background, practice, themes, and process based on the document.
- Include:
  - Where she is based.
  - Her role as digital collage artist and freelance graphic designer.
  - Her use of vintage/public-domain imagery and surreal, symbolic storytelling.
  - Her freelance history (since around 2015) and expansion into prints, online platforms, and NFTs.
- End with a short, cohesive "artist statement" paragraph using the seed ideas from the document.

**Portfolio**
- Propose 3–4 portfolio section descriptions (e.g., Surreal Collage Series, Vintage & Archive Remix, Editorial & Illustration, NFTs & Digital Collectibles).
- For each section, write a short intro paragraph that explains what kind of work belongs there and what a viewer should notice or feel.
- Do **not** invent specific artwork titles; speak in general terms that still feel concrete and evocative.

**Shop / Prints**
- Explain that selected works are available as prints and products (e.g., metal prints on Displate), referencing the platforms mentioned in the document.
- Encourage visitors to purchase prints, mentioning quality, collectability, and how the work looks in physical spaces.
- Include a call to action that can easily link out to her external shop (like Displate).

**NFTs & Crypto Art**
- Describe her presence as a collage-maker and NFT artist.
- Mention that her surreal digital collage style extends into curated NFT drops on platforms referenced in the document (e.g., those linked via her Beacons hub, Exchange Art example).
- Emphasize scarcity, uniqueness, and the continuity between her traditional digital collage work and her NFTs.
- Include a CTA for collectors to explore or follow upcoming drops.

**Writing & Features**
- Summarize her involvement with platforms such as SmokeLong Quarterly, YNST Magazine, and any notable community features mentioned in the document.
- Do not fabricate article titles; instead, describe the nature of these features (bio, contributor page, community post).
- Provide copy that can sit above a list of external links.

**Contact**
- Write friendly, professional copy inviting:
  - Collaboration inquiries
  - Commission requests
  - Licensing questions
  - General messages from viewers and collectors
- Assume the site will have a contact form and optional social links; write text that works with a generic form plus links to Instagram, X (Twitter), and other profiles.

#### 3. Use of Links and Platforms

- Do **not** output raw URLs in every sentence; instead, write copy that can sit near buttons (e.g., "View full portfolio on Behance," "Explore prints on Displate," "Visit the link hub for all platforms").
- Keep platform names consistent with the background doc (e.g., Behance, Displate, Beacons, HUG.art, SmokeLong Quarterly, YNST Magazine, Exchange Art, etc.).

#### 4. Constraints

- Do not invent personal life details, education history, awards, or exhibition lists that are not in the document.
- Do not fabricate quotes from Jolene; instead, write in a descriptive third-person narrator voice.
- You may slightly infer general artistic motivations (introspection, imagination, narrative, symbolism) as long as they stay consistent with the documented themes.

#### 5. Output Format

Structure the final answer as clearly labeled sections:
- HOME_PAGE_COPY
- ABOUT_PAGE_COPY
- PORTFOLIO_PAGE_COPY
- SHOP_PRINTS_PAGE_COPY
- NFTS_PAGE_COPY
- WRITING_FEATURES_PAGE_COPY
- CONTACT_PAGE_COPY

Within each section, use Markdown headings and short paragraphs/bulleted lists so the developer can easily copy-paste into the site.

Use the background document faithfully and focus on clarity, warmth, and cohesion across all pages.
