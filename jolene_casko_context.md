## Artistic Background & Journey

### Origin Story
- Made her first collage 20 years ago at age 12 (circa 2003)
- Started with physical collages using magazine clippings
- Still occasionally creates hand-made collages, but now primarily works digitally
- Transitioned to digital work using Adobe Photoshop
- Became a full-time NFT artist in 2022

### Artistic Philosophy
**Direct quote from Jolene:**
> "My art is often inspired by music. My favourite way to create art is by turning on music, letting a song evoke emotion within me, and then creating a surreal scene that expresses the emotion. Collage is the perfect art form for this because the art is made of layers upon layers, just as emotions are."

### Creative Process
1. **Listen** - Immerses herself in music or poetry that evokes emotion
2. **Visualize** - Lets the emotions guide her vision for surreal scenes
3. **Layer** - Uses Photoshop to blend vintage elements, space imagery, and natural forms
4. **Refine** - Perfects each piece until it captures the exact emotion she felt
