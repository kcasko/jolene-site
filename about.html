            <!-- Origin story -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    I made my first collage at 12 with magazine clippings and glue. I didn't know what I was doing—just cutting, layering, trying to make sense of how images could talk to each other. Twenty years later, I'm still doing the same thing, just with more tools and a clearer sense of what I'm after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That first piece was chaotic and imperfect, but it taught me something important: collage works because it mirrors how we actually experience things. Memory isn't linear. Emotion isn't singular. Everything we feel is made of fragments that overlap and contradict and somehow make sense together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I work in Photoshop, where the medium can hold as much depth as I need it to. The process is the same—layering, adjusting, finding the moment when separate pieces become one cohesive thing. But the possibilities are wider. I can pull from vintage photographs, space imagery, botanical archives, old film stills—anything that carries the right weight.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Creative process -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>How I Work</h2>
                <p>
                    Music guides most of what I make. I'll put on a song, let it move through me, and start building a scene that mirrors the emotion it left behind. Sometimes it's a specific lyric that sparks an image. Sometimes it's just the mood—the way a track makes you feel suspended or restless or like you're remembering something you never actually experienced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collage is the perfect medium for this because it's inherently about layers. Just like memory. Just like sound. Just like the way feelings compound and refract over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't sketch first. I start with a feeling and an image—usually a portrait or a central figure—and build outward. I'll try dozens of combinations, moving elements around until something clicks. The piece tells me when it's done. It's less about planning and more about listening.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Working with musicians -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Collaborating Through Sound</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of my commissioned work is album art for musicians. It's where my process fits most naturally because I'm already creating from music—it makes sense to create <em>for</em> music too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When someone reaches out about a project, I start by listening. Not just to the tracks, but to what they're trying to say with them—the mood, the memory, the feeling they want someone to carry away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, I build. I pull imagery that echoes the tone, layer it until it feels right, and share drafts as we go. This isn't a one-sided process. Your input shapes the direction. I'm here to translate your sound into something visual, not to impose a style on top of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been doing this long enough to know that the best work comes from conversation, not assumption. So we'll talk first—about the music, the vision, the vibe you're after. Then I'll create something that feels like it belongs to the same world your songs do.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Professional background -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been creating art as a hobby for over 20 years, but I started freelancing professionally in 2015. In February 2022, I transitioned to full-time work as a digital artist and NFT creator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work has been featured in various publications and galleries, and I've collaborated with musicians across genres—from indie folk to ambient electronic to classical crossover. Each project is different, which keeps the work interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond album art, I take on personal commissions, editorial projects, and conceptual pieces. I also sell prints and create NFT collections for collectors who connect with the surreal and the layered.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Personal details -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Beyond the Work</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, though I work with clients everywhere. I'm a mother, an Aquarius, an INFP—all of which probably explain why I'm drawn to emotion-driven, introspective work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not creating, I'm usually listening to music, reading poetry (Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe are longtime favorites), or hunting for vintage imagery in obscure archives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still occasionally make physical collages with magazine clippings. There's something grounding about working with your hands, about the limitations of paper and glue. It reminds me where this all started.
                </p>

                <h2>On Collage as an Art Form</h2>
                <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgba(255,250,205,0.3); padding-left: 25px; font-style: italic; color: #d9cbe5; font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.8;">
                    "Collage is the perfect art form because the art is made of layers upon layers, just as emotions are. You take fragments—images that weren't meant to exist together—and arrange them until they tell a story that couldn't be told any other way. That's what resonates with me. The unexpected combinations. The way meaning emerges from juxtaposition."
